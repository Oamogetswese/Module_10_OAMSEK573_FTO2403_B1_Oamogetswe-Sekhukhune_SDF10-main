## [SDF10] API Learning Reflection ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the [SDF10] API Learning Reflection! Through this exercise, you will reflect on key concepts, practical experiences, and the tools you've encountered or used in API interactions.

1. **Understanding and Application**: Reflecting on the key concepts, can you explain in your own words what an API is and its significance in software development? Provide an example of how you have used or encountered an API in a project or a practical scenario.

[API(application programming interface) a software mediator that allows two or more applications to talk to each other.]

2. **Conceptual Distinctions**: How would you differentiate between an interface and an API? 

[the interface, is what the user sees, and API(Application Programming Interface) , is used to communicate with the underlying application or system.]

3. **Components and Types of APIs**: Can you identify the main components of an API and describe their roles? Reflect on the different types of APIs mentioned (e.g., Web APIs, RESTful APIs) and discuss which type you find most intriguing or useful, and why.

[RESTFUL APIs is a style that allows developers to access web services in an easy and consistent way, and Web APIs make use of data from various sources. I find the Web APIs more useful as it gives you most of the easier access to data.]

4. **Practical Application and Tools**: Reflect on your experience with API exploration and implementation. Have you used any specific tools (such as Curl or API exploration tools) or libraries to interact with APIs? 

[Yes I have used tools like curl to transfer data using various network protocols. Also SoapUI to help me write, run, integrate, and automate advanced API Tests in my projects.]

5. **Learning and Improvement**: Considering the key concepts and your practical experiences, identify one area related to APIs where you feel confident and one area where you see a need for improvement. What steps will you take to enhance your understanding and skills in the area you wish to improve?

[I need to learn how to learn more APIs in order to use it more in my projects, and more ways to learn how to use CuRL commands and more tools.]
